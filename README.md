# HOSTS
HOSTS files can help protect educational environments from inappropriate materials online.

The goal is to only allow games on Fridays.  Creative projects should be made Monday-Thursday.

There are four main types of files here.
  * F files allow games.
  * MTWR files block games.
  * win files use the End of Line formatting for Windows systems.
  * unix files use the End of Line formatting for Linux, Mac, routers, and Unix systems.

I am looking for help with the following:
  * adding domains to this list
  * correcting improper categorazation
